How to mod your game:
Go to your Application.streamingAssetsPath (Game folder/folder with _data name/StreamingAssets) then create folder named Mods
Go inside Mods folder, and then create your mod folder (for example AliveBox folder)
Go inside it, then create info.json:
{
  "name": "Alive Box",
  "textureName": "texture.png",
  "category": "Live",
  "isSolid": true,
  "isPhysics": true,
  "mass": 5.0
}
Name is mod name
TextureName is texture that is being used by the mod
category is your mod category (Live, Misc, Explosives, Destructive)
isSolid makes your object solid
isPhysics makes your mod have physics
mass: The mass is given in arbitrary units, but the basic physical principles of mass apply. 
Newton's classic equation `force = mass multiplied by acceleration`, demonstrates that the larger an object's mass, 
the more force it requires to accelerate it to a given velocity. An object with large mass will be moved less by a collision than an object with lower mass.
